 "There is a loneliness in this world so great that you can see it in the slow movement of the hands of a clock. People so tired, mutilated...either by love or no love. People are just not good to each other. The rich are not good to the rich. The poor are not good to the poor. We are afraid. Our educational system tells us that we can all be big-ass winners. It hasn’t told us about the gutters or the suicides. Or the terror of one person aching in one place, alone. Untouched, unspoken to, watering a plant. People are not good to each other. People are not good to each other. People are not good to each other. I suppose they never will be. I don’t ask them to be. But sometimes I think about it...Too much, too little...More haters than lovers. People are not good to each other. Perhaps if they were our deaths would not be so sad... There must be a way. Surely there must be a way that we have not yet thought of."
