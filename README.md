# ManifestosAndTextualTouchstones
Things that help me (and maybe you) navigate this increasingly sudden/scary/startling techno-ecological life. the singularity isn't what they predicted. So navigation requires the books of science, art and religion/humanism, and critical thinking, and everything else. 
Some days it's the Desdriata that will get you there, other days it Dunne&Raby.

These are texts: machines to think with.
