# ManifestosAndTextualTouchstones
Things that help me (and maybe you) navigate this increasingly sudden/scary/startling techno-ecological life. the singularity isnt what they predicted. So it need's the books of science and religion/humanism, and critical thinking, and everything else. 
Some days its the Desdriata, other days it Dunne&Raby.

These are texts: machines to think with.
