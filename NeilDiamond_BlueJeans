Forever in Blue Jeans - Neil Diamond

Money talks
But it don't sing and dance
And it don't walk
And long as I can have you
Here with me, I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans

Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me
I'd like to say
We'll do okay
Forever in blue jeans

Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire
All alone you and I
Nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs

Money talks
But it can't sing and dance
And it can't walk
And long as I can have you
Here with me, I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, babe

And honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me I'd like to say
We'll do okay
Forever in blue jeans

Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire
All alone you and I
Nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs

Money talks
But it can't sing and dance
And it can't walk
And long as I can have you
Here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans

And if you pardon me
I'd like to say
We'll do okay
Forever in blue jeans, babe
And long as I can have you
Here with me I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, babe

"Forever in Blue Jeans" is a song by Neil Diamond which was co-written with his guitarist Richard Bennett. This up-tempo track, released as a single by Columbia in February 1979, was taken from the previous year's Neil Diamond album You Don't Bring Me Flowers.

According to Cotton Incorporated "Neil Diamond might have been right when he named his 1979 #1 hit "Forever in Blue Jeans": 81% of women are planning their next jeans purchase to be some shade of blue." [1] The song, needless to say, has been used to promote the sale of blue jeans, most notably Will Ferrell, impersonating Neil Diamond singing, for The Gap.

You Don't Bring Me Flowers is an album by Neil Diamond released in 1978 to capitalize on the success of the title song, a duet with Barbra Streisand, which had originally appeared as a solo recording on Diamond's previous album, I'm Glad You're Here With Me Tonight.
